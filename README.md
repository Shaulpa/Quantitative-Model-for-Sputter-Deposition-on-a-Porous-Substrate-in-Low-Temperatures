This repository contians the scripts for the paper "Quantitative Model for Sputter Deposition on a Porous Substrate in Low Temperatures". 
In order to get the top-down and cross-section views of a single simulation use "final_script_for_checks_and_drawings.m", and in order to compare properties between many simulations use "final_script_for_comparative_graphs.m"
